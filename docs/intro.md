# Beginner’s Guide

PolyCityDex is a multi-chain compatible decentralized exchange aggregator protocol focused on making no-fee transactions possible. PolyCityDex aims to make on-chain trading simple and easy by providing access to multi-chains like Polygon, BSC, HECO Chain, and OKExChain under one roof. The design of the core product allows it to function gasless and focused on aggregating liquidity from multiple protocols.

PolyCityDex’s vision is to provide 100% decentralized products and solutions to access on-chain decentralized finance.

## What is PolyCityDex?

PolyCityDex is a community-driven organization built to solve what might be called the “liquidity problem”. One could define this problem as the inability of disparate forms of liquidity to connect with markets in a decentralized way, and vice versa. While other solutions provide incrementally progressive advances toward solving the problem of liquidity, PolyCityDex’s progress is intended to create a broader range of network effects. Rather than limiting itself to a single solution, PolyCityDex intertwines many decentralized markets and instruments. Thus far, the core products, which will be described in more detail here, include a decentralized exchange, a decentralized lending market, yield instruments, and staking derivatives. PolyCityDex’s products are configured in a way that allows the entire platform to maintain decentralized governance of PICHI token holders, while continuing to innovate on the collective foundations by design. Whereas major structural changes are voted on by the community, the day-to-day operations, rebalancing of pools and ratios, business strategy, and overall development is ultimately decided on by our MasterChef and the core team.

The following documentation details the functional and technical aspects of the ecosystem products, as well as customized video tutorials attached.
