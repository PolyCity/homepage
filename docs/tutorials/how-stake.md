# How to Stake $PICHI

PolyCityDex not only offers you the opportunity to earn $PICHI and share in platform fees with your dormant tokens, you can also earn xPICHI tokens from your PICHI tokens! Rewards on rewards! xPICHI holders earn 5% of all platform transaction fees, regardless if you hold any other platform tokens or have any liquidity pairs or not. All you need are some $PICHI tokens and, as always, some Matic (MATIC) to get started! 

## Staking 101

Step 1: Head to https://polycity.xyz/ and click Launch App.

Step 2: Connect your wallet to PolyCityDex (make sure you have some Matic to cover gas fees!).

Step 3: Ensure that you have $PICHI tokens to stake in your wallet and click the "Stake" tab.

Step 4: Input the amount of PICHI tokens you wish to stake or click “Max,” then click, you guessed it, “Confirm Staking.”

Step 5: Approve the transaction in your wallet and you’re all set.  

You can find details about the performance of xPICHI, on the PolyCityHall page and if you’d like to see more detailed analytics, you can click the “Your PolyCityHall Stats” to see your profit/loss information, etc.

You might be wondering what the value of xPICHI is to make staking worthwhile. Well, for starters, as mentioned, 0.05% of all transaction fees go to PICHI stakers. The redeployment of limit orders will have all fees allocated to xPICHI holders and with the introduction of the AntiqueBox & Kusho, fees accrued from these lending services will also go to xPICHI holders.

Once per day or more, the liquidity provider rewards contracts are closed and all LP tokens are swapped for PICHI tokens, which are sent, proportionately, to xPICHI holders. At this time, xPICHI would have a greater value than the bought PICHI tokens.

Many people also wonder if it’s better to farm $PICHI on other platforms in lieu of staking. One of the benefits of staking PICHI over using it to farm is that you can use your staked PICHI in other DeFi protocols. For instance, you can lend your xPICHI as collateral, use that to borrow MATIC, then use that borrowed MATIC to farm another asset with an even higher APY. It can really be used to maximize token yield potential.

Users can unstake at any time and there is no vesting period associated with xPICHI tokens.
