# How to Earn Yield

https://app.polycity.xyz/farm

Earning yield on PolyCityDex is connected to being a liquidity provider, but it is also different because you earn $PICHI token rewards. Our yield farms are branded on PolyCity as Yield Farming. You can take a look at the current Yield Farming pair options at https://app.polycity.xyz/yield. There are other yield-bearing instruments, but this tutorial will focus on the Yield Farming pairs. 

When new pools are added to the Yield Farming, their yields are quite high and as more users enter the yield pairs, the APY balances out, as shown in the screenshot above.

## Yield Farming  101

Step 1: Head to https://polycity.xyz/ and click Launch App.

Step 2: Connect your wallet to PolyCityDex (Make sure you have some Matic to cover gas fees!).

Step 3: You need to add liquidity to the yield farming pair first. You can do so by following the steps in the How to Add/Remove Liquidity section or supply straight on the Yield page. 

Step 4: Select the farm or Yield Farming pair you wish to join and deposit your Poly-LP (PolyCity Liquidity Provider) tokens into the farm by entering the amount you wish to add or by clicking “Max” and click “Deposit.” 

Step 5: Approve the relevant fees and start growing your $PICHI! Farming will happen immediately once the transaction completes.


On PolyCity, you can enter a Permanent Farm or an Yield Farming. Yield Farming pairs are temporary farms that are allocated bonus $PICHI rewards, through allocation points. Allocation points are allotted based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, like sentiment and market capitalization. Usually, the higher the interest rate, in relation to the total value of the farm, means the higher the allocation points.

Please note that $PICHI rewards no longer have any vesting or lockup period.

Since farming is related to liquidity providing, is it important to note that the same impermanent loss risks are still present.

## Exiting Yield Farming 101 

Once a temporary Yield Farming pair is no longer bearing yield, you will probably want to remove your position.

Step 1: Head to https://polycity.xyz/ and click Launch App.

Step 2: Connect your wallet to PolyCityDex (make sure you have some Matic to cover gas fees!).

Step 3: Click the Yield tab and wait for Your Yields to load.

Step 4: Select the farm or Yield Farming pair you wish to no longer participate in and click “Harvest x.xx PICHI”

Step 5: Approve the transaction from your wallet and you’re all set! Note: You can also remove the liquidity position entirely on this page as well.
