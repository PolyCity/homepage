# Setting Up Your Wallet

http://metamask.io/

When you go to https://app.polycity.xyz, enter the app and click "Connect Wallet", you will see a list of wallet options to choose from. For some beginners, this list can be daunting. To help out new users to our platform, we will show you how to set up a MetaMask wallet extension on your desktop.

## Setting up MetaMask 101

Step 1: Head over to https://metamask.io/.

Step 2: Download and install the MetaMask version compatible with your browser.

Step 3: After it's finished downloading click "Get Started".

Step 4: Click "Create a Wallet".

Step 5: Agree or disagree to information collection.

Step 6: Create your password (You won't need a username!).

Step 7: You will be given your backup phrase, also known as your "private key", which is made up of 12 words. It is good practice to write this down somewhere safe and never show or tell anyone these words. Anyone who has this phrase can access your assets and do as they please with them. So don't ever give it to anyone!

Step 8: Congratulations, your wallet has successfully been created! Your account number or wallet address will look something like this: 0xdB2fDB1C46622cc8e1b7DE79cd9c692ef5b718FC or as seen in the photo below: 0xdB2f...18FC. If you click on this number (abbreviated below "Account 1"), your computer will automatically copy the address.

Step 9: If you already own cryptocurrencies you can add assets by copying your wallet address and sending the assets you own to that address.

Step 10: In order for your tokens to display in your wallet, you need to add the token first. Let's start by adding $PICHI!

Step 11: To add the $PICHI token to your wallet, start by heading to: https://polygonscan.com/. 

Step 12: Search PolyCityDex Token in the search bar and click the top result.

Step 13: Copy the contract address.

Step 14: Open MetaMask again. If you cannot find the extension, click the puzzle piece in the top right corner of your browser. You can pin MetaMask to your extensions for easier access as well.

Step 15: Click "Add Token". 

Step 16:  Click "Custom Token". 

Step 17: Paste the $PICHI token contract address in and click "Next".

Step 18: Click "Add Token", and you should now see the $PICHI token in your wallet.


## Connecting your wallet to PolyCity

Step 1: Go to https://app.polycity.xyz.

Step 2: Click "Connect to a wallet" in the top right corner.

Step 3: Select MetaMask then click "Connect" in the MetaMask pop-up.

Step 4: You will now see your wallet address in the top right corner.

You will need to approve PolyCity's access for each individual token you use on the platform. For example, if you want to buy $PICHI tokens with $USDC, you will need to approve PolyCity's access to the USDC token by paying a small connection fee. As we mentioned in the beginning of this tutorial, this fee, along with other fees on Polygon, will need to be paid in Matic (MATIC). So, in order to access the PolyCityDex platform, you will need MATIC in your wallet to pay the fees. If you do not have any Matic, you will need to purchase some from a centralized exchange which services your region.
