# Staking: the PolyCityHall

https://app.polycity.xyz/stake

## What is xPICHI?

xPICHI is a token, similar to our Poly-LP tokens, that you receive in exchange for staking PICHI tokens in the PolyCityHall. While holding the token, it will appreciate in value, as fees from our exchange platform are "served to the PolyCityHall". The xPICHI token is always worth more than a regular PICHI token, because xPICHI accrues value from platform fees. When users make trades on the PolyCityDex exchange a 0.3% fee is charged. 0.05% of this fee is added to the PolyCityHall pool in the form of LP tokens. When the rewards contract is called (minimum once per day) all the LP tokens are sold for Pichi (on PolyCityDex Exchange). The newly purchased Pichi is then divided up proportionally between all of the xPICHI holders in the pool, meaning their xPICHI is now worth more PICHI. Because of the way the rewards are generated, the price of xPICHI will increase with the value of PICHI, and the value of one xPICHI will always be greater than the value of one PICHI. Fees generated into the PolyCityHall are vested for a period of time [see the Vesting FAQ].
